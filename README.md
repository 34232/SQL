As a data analyst, you can use SQL (Structured Query Language) to transform raw datasets into meaningful insights by directly querying and managing relational databases. SQL allows you to clean and prepare data by handling duplicates, missing values, and formatting issues, ensuring consistency across reports. With aggregation functions like SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), and grouping operations, you can calculate KPIs, track performance trends, and compare results across categories or time periods. SQL’s ability to join tables through INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and UNION makes it powerful for combining multiple sources into a unified view of complex datasets. While SQL itself is not a visualization tool, it integrates seamlessly with platforms such as Power BI, Tableau, and Excel, providing clean, structured data for dashboards and interactive reports. Advanced features like window functions and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) enable deeper analytics, including cohort analysis, ranking, and rolling calculations.
